                    <p class="card__text">Since that time, it has been widely used as a garment by the common people. It is one of the most famous cotton woven fabrics in Japan, especially in the Chikugo region of present-day Fukuoka Prefecture (the former Kurume domain).</p>

The appeal of Kurume Kasuri is its excellent durability and wide variety of patterns, including geometric patterns, medium patterns with floral patterns, and large patterns such as checkered patterns.</p>
                    <p class="card__text">In the past, small patterns were used for men’s wear, medium patterns with floral patterns were used for women’s wear, and especially large patterns were used for bedding, but now they are used for all purposes.</p>
